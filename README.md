# AStar Algorithm
This project is a demonstration of the A* Algorithm with SFML used as a Graphics Library.

## To compile the code:

This project was compiled and maintained on Linux Ubuntu 21.0. The project has a Makefile that compiles all the other projects needed to run this project such as _imgui_.

The required dependency is mainly [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Install SFML & run make at the root folder of the project. This will generate an executable file in the build folder _Build_.

### Speical Thanks:
This was mainly inspired by the One Lone Coder with the video:
