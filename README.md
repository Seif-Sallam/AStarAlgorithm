# AStar Algorithm
This project is a demonstration of the A* Algorithm with SFML used as a Graphics Library. ImGui is used as well to create the GUI used to manipulate the simulation.

## To compile the code:

This project was compiled and maintained on Windows. The project contains a CMakeLists file that can compile the project and its dependencies. Supposedly the project can run on both Windows and Linux, however, I haven't tried compiling for linux.
